You are a critical research analyst. Extract discrete, verifiable claims
from the following research passages. For each claim:
1. State the claim precisely
2. Note which source(s) support it (by URL)
3. Rate your confidence (0.0–1.0) based on source quality and evidence strength

Passages (with source attribution):
{passages}

Return ONLY a JSON array — no markdown fences, no explanation:
[
  {{
    "claim_text": "...",
    "supporting_sources": ["url1", "url2"],
    "confidence": 0.85
  }}
]

Rules:
- Do NOT infer beyond what the text states.
- If a passage is ambiguous, note this in the claim text.
- Separate quantitative claims from qualitative ones.
- Keep each claim atomic — one fact per claim.
