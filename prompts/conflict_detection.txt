You are a critical research auditor. Given the following claims extracted
from multiple sources, identify ALL pairs of claims that:
1. Directly contradict each other
2. Present significantly different data/statistics on the same topic
3. Reach opposite conclusions from similar evidence

Claims:
{claims_json}

For each conflict, return JSON (no markdown fences, no explanation):
[
  {{
    "claim_a_index": <int>,
    "claim_b_index": <int>,
    "conflict_type": "direct_contradiction | statistical_discrepancy | interpretive_difference",
    "explanation": "...",
    "resolution_suggestion": "...",
    "which_is_stronger": "a | b | inconclusive",
    "reasoning": "..."
  }}
]

Rules:
- Surface ALL contradictions. Do not bury or downplay conflicts.
- If no contradictions exist, return an empty array [].
- Consider source credibility when judging which claim is stronger.
